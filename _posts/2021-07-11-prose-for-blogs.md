Prose.io is called "a content editor for GitHub". `Prose` is very similar to the visual editor included in older versions of `WordPress` that many people use for writing blog posts.

Information [here](https://www.websbytodd.com/documentation/using-prose/)

One thing is does really well is it gives people the ability to update their own websites, especially those who don't have the time and energy to learn how to write code. While there is plenty of great technical documentation for Prose on GitHub, there is very little documentation for people who don't code. 
## Prose.io

Prose is a content editor that allows simple draft post creation for `github` (and `jekyll`) through a web interface for simple markdown. Markdown is very easy to learn as it is ment to be able to be read as plain text as well as rendered as a document like word or html.

### Blogs

I really just use it to enter the text and ideas for blogs. It makes it easier to sit in a cafe and write an idea down that then can be included as a blog post or documentation for a project I am working on. I like using it at the moment because I have been able to test the effectiveness of my markdown code to render the posts and information I use regularly in `R`. 

A couple of key points that make `prose` good:

1. Makes automatic commit lines when you save

2. Shortcut for saving in windows `ctrl s` works as a automatic commit making it easy to update draft after you have made comments

3. Easy for short passages of text == good for a blog

4. Uses markdown which results in much easier inclusion in other markdown flavours such as RMarkdown (hint hint)

Maybe in the future this will be a good tool to get simple ideas from the notepad to the publication level quicker?

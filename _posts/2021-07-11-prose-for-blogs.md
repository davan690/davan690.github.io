## Prose.io

Prose is a content editor that allows simple draft post creation for `github` (and `jekyll`) through a web interface for simple markdown. Markdown is very easy to learn as it is ment to be able to be read as plain text as well as rendered as a document like word or html.

### Blogs

I really just use it to enter the text and ideas for blogs. It makes it easier to sit in a cafe and write an idea down that then can be included as a blog post or documentation for a project I am working on. I like using it at the moment because I have been able to test the effectiveness of my markdown code to render the posts and information I use regularly in `R`. 

A couple of key points that make `prose` good:

1. Makes automatic commit lines when you save

2. Shortcut for saving in windows `ctrl s` works as a automatic commit making it easy to update draft after you have made comments

3. Easy for short passages of text == good for a blog

4. Uses markdown which results in much easier inclusion in other markdown flavours such as RMarkdown (hint hint)

Maybe in the future this will be a good tool to get simple ideas from the notepad to the publication level quicker?
